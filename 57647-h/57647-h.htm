<h2><a name="QUEENS_MESSENGERS" id="QUEENS_MESSENGERS">QUEEN’S MESSENGERS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Somewhat</span> more than forty years ago, Mr Baillie
Fraser published a lively and instructive volume
under the title <cite>A Winter’s Journey (Tatâr) from
Constantinople to Teheran</cite>. Political complications
had arisen between Russia and Turkey‒an
old story, of which we are witnessing a new version
at the present time. The English government
deemed it urgently necessary to send out instructions
to our representatives at Constantinople and
Teheran; and this could only be done in those
days by means of Messengers bold and hardy
enough to bear a great amount of fatigue in the
saddle. Mr Fraser, intrusted with this duty, told
the tale of his hard work. The word <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">Tatâr</i>, in
Turkey, is applied to a native courier, guide, and
companion, a hardy horseman who fulfils all these
functions, speaking two or more languages, and
ready to do the best that can be done to overcome
the multiplied tribulations of regions almost roadless
and innless. When travelling Tatâr, these
men have been known to make truly wonderful
journeys on horseback. One of special character
was made in 1815, when the British government
wished to convey to Persia the stirring news of
the escape of Napoleon from Elba. The British
Embassy at Constantinople sent a Messenger from
thence to Demavend, a Persian city nearly two
thousand miles distant, across a dangerously rugged
country; this amazing horse-ride was accomplished
in seventeen days; averaging nearly a hundred and
twenty miles a day.</p>

<p>Mr Baillie Fraser gives a vivid description of his
own experience in this kind of life, riding day
and night, and stopping only when the absolute
need of a few hours’ rest drove him into a
wretched post-house or a mere hovel. It was
‘a Tatâr journey of two thousand six hundred
miles, which for fatigue and anxiety, and suffering
from cold and exposure, I will venture to match
against anything of the sort that ever was done.’
First came seven hundred and fifty miles across
European Turkey, from Belgrade to Constantinople;
and then seven hundred along the whole
extent of Asia Minor to Amasia; but during the
remaining seven weeks of the journey, he says:
‘We have been wading night and day through
interminable wastes of deep snow, exposed to all
the violence of storms, drift, and wind, with the
thermometer frequently from fifteen to twenty
degrees below zero. Our clothes and faces and
beards were clotted into stiff masses of ice; our
boots, hard as iron, frozen to the stirrup; and
our limbs tortured with pain, or chilled into
insensibility by intense cold.’</p>

<p>Another famous journey across European Turkey,
in 1849, has been described by Major Byng Hall,
whose volume we shall presently advert to. A
Messenger was directed to haste as fast as horse-flesh
could carry him from Belgrade to the Morava,
then on through Alexinitz and Nissa, across the
Balkans, and so on through Sofia to Constantinople‒in
great part the very route which Russian
and Turkish troops have been devastating. When
he crossed the Balkans at one of the passes or
ravines, he had been riding continually night and
day, and reeled backward and forward in his
saddle; and more than once he nearly fell to the
ground through exhaustion and want of sleep, at
places where precipices were perilously near. He
reached Constantinople in five days eleven hours
from Belgrade, contending the whole time on horseback
against wind, mud, and rain. Sir Stratford
Canning (now Lord Stratford de Redcliffe), British
ambassador at Constantinople, complimented him
by saying that it was ‘the quickest winter journey
ever known.’ Lord Palmerston adverted in the
House of Commons to this journey, on an occasion
when some members were animadverting on the
great cost of the diplomatic service: ‘As a proof
of the zeal with which these royal Messengers
render their services to the government of this
country, I will mention an instance in which one
of these gentlemen performed his duty on an occasion
when it was required that he should make an
extraordinary effort in order to carry a despatch of
very considerable importance from the Foreign
Office to Constantinople, at a time when a question
was pending between Russia and Turkey. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
days and nights in the saddle without quitting it,
and performed the journey in the worst weather
and under the greatest possible difficulties.’</p>

<p>Major Byng Hall, just named, has published
a pleasant work under the title of the <cite>Queen’s
Messenger</cite>, recounting some of his own journeys
and those of his colleagues. Amongst others was
a sledge-journey to St Petersburg in midwinter;
when his driver got intoxicated, drove into some
sledges coming in the opposite direction, and
nearly brought about a perilous scene of scuffle
and bloodshed‒all in a dark night amid enormous
accumulations of snow. He draws attention to
the varied qualifications necessary to any one who
fills this office: ‘No man, be he who he may, who
holds the post of one of Her Majesty’s foreign
Messengers, and who must, for the due performance
of the constant and arduous duties intrusted
to him, be acquainted with foreign languages, but
must obtain much knowledge by the wayside,
impracticable if not impossible to the holiday
traveller’‒which all becomes essentially serviceable
to him in subsequent journeys. A writer in
<cite>Blackwood</cite> pleasantly spoke a few years ago of
these ‘foreign Mercuries, who travel throughout
Europe at a pace only short of the telegraph. They
are wonderful fellows, and must be very variously
endowed. What capital sleepers, and yet so easily
awakened! What a deal of bumping must their
heads be equal to! What an indifference must
they be endowed with to bad dinners, bad roads,
bad servants, and bad smells! How patient must
they be here, how peremptory there! How they
must train their stomachs to long fastings, and
their skin to little soap!’</p>

<p>And now for a brief account of the organisation
of this small but remarkable body of men.</p>

<p>The Queen’s Messengers of the present day are
virtually <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">employés</i> of the Foreign Office; seeing
that the conveyance of despatches to and from
British ambassadors and representatives at foreign
courts is the chief duty intrusted to them. Many
a declaration of war has been thus conveyed.</p>

<p>About thirty years ago the House of Commons
requested and obtained from the Foreign Office an
account of the expense connected with the system
of Queen’s Messengers. The payments to these
gentlemen were found to be made up in an odd
way, such as no commercial firm would dream of
adopting. There was a small annual salary,
whether the Messenger were travelling or not.
There were board wages, so much per day when in
actual service. There was an allowance for his
trouble, anxiety, and fatigue in riding and driving
along‒so much a mile if on horseback, so much
in a vehicle, so much in a steam-boat. There was
a reimbursement for actual outlay for railways,
vehicles, horses, postillions, hostlers, road and
bridge tolls, passports, loss on exchange of moneys,
&amp;c. This reimbursement was in nearly all cases
more than he actually paid, owing to the liberal
scale on which it was calculated.</p>

<p>Every Messenger, it was found, received about
four hundred a year for himself, and six hundred
for travel-outlay. Some of the journeys, we learn
from the parliamentary paper, were enormously
expensive; railways on the continent were at that
time comparatively few, and the old system of
posting and horse-riding had still to be kept up
over very long distances. One single journey from
London to Frankfurt was set down at L.46; to
Berlin, L.70; to Turin, L.83; to Vienna, L.86; to
Madrid, L.123; to Rome, L.143; to Naples, L.162.
The giant items were: London to St Petersburg
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viâ</i> Berlin (1964 miles), L.166; and London to
Constantinople <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viâ</i> Vienna (2192 miles), L.269.
It is probable that at that time there was scarcely
any rail beyond Vienna, whatever may have been
the case on this side; and that the Messenger to
Constantinople had to travel by relays of horses or
of post vehicles more than eleven hundred miles
of his journey. The outward journey alone is
mentioned in each instance; the homeward was
probably about equal to it in cost. One Messenger,
Mr Crotch, went from Calais to Paris (carrying
despatches which had come from London <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viâ</i>
Dover) sixteen times in the year, and sixteen times
in the reverse direction; receiving about L.25 per
journey for expenses and emoluments.</p>

<p>In 1868 the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs
resolved that the time had come for remodelling
the system. In a circular addressed to all British
representatives abroad, he pointed out numerous
ways in which the number of despatches sent
might be reduced, and the expense lessened still
more considerably. The post and the electric
telegraph might safely be intrusted, under the
improved modern arrangements, with many of the
questions, answers, and instructions hitherto conveyed
by Queen’s Messengers. It was also pointed
out that, when telegrams were sent, an unnecessary
verbiage was indulged in, tending to increase the
cost without in any way conducing to the intelligibility
of the message. The employment of cipher-writing<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
would be available by post and by telegraph
as well as by Messenger, so long as the key
to the cipher is known only to the Foreign Office.</p>

<p>Irrespective of the quantity of circumlocution
involved in the matter, there is the question of
emolument to the Messengers employed. The
Foreign Secretary found, on close examination,
that these gentlemen were in the receipt of eight
hundred a year each on an average. The amount
had doubled itself in the course of twenty years,
chiefly by means of the profit derived from the
allowance for travelling‒economical railway and
steam-boat fares being charged to the government
as if they were the expensive old-fashioned fares.
Thus the mileage <em>profit</em> increased as the mileage <em>expenditure</em>
decreased. All these lumbering arrangements
were swept away, and a fixed salary decided
on, just as for government clerks, &amp;c. Five hundred
a year was the amount decided on, to be
paid whether the Messenger were employed or
unemployed, whether at home or abroad.</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that by the introduction
of railways the duties of these Messengers have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
been immensely simplified. ‘For many years they
have scarcely if ever been called upon to travel on
horseback; the communication with Constantinople,
which was formerly carried on partly by
that means, having for some time past been wholly
kept up by railway and steam-vessel. In consequence
of the accelerated rate of travelling by
railway, they are rarely kept out of bed as formerly,
for six, eight, ten, or even more nights;
and even when they are travelling at night, they
are almost always able to enjoy uninterrupted rest,
instead of being obliged, as formerly, to be constantly
on the alert, in order to stimulate the exertions
of postillions and owner.’</p>

<p>The salary was subsequently settled by making
the amount five hundred guineas instead of
pounds.</p>

<p>Important personages in their way are these
foreign Messengers, sufficiently high in social
position to comprise among their number (at the
present time) an ‘honourable,’ a major, and six
captains. Evidently the post is eagerly sought
for when a vacancy occurs. One of those at present
in the service has been a Messenger during
the long period of thirty-five years: what a prodigious
amount of travel he must have gone
through! Good salaries are not the only attractions;
several past Messengers have retired on
pensions, pretty well wearied of knocking about
Europe; while widows of Messengers receive
allowances under exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>Smart-looking personages are these messengers,
as attired to distinguish them from ordinary
civilians. The official regulations on this subject
tell us that ‘the Messengers must be furnished
with a uniform‒consisting of a dark-blue cloth
double-breasted frock coat with turn-down collar;
blue single-breasted waistcoat, buttoned up to the
throat, with edging of gold-lace; trousers of Oxford
mixture, with a scarlet cord down the side seams;
gilt buttons embossed with the royal arms encircled
by the crown and garter, and having a greyhound
pendent; blue cloth cap with leather peak, band
of black braid, and the royal cipher and crown gilt
in front; a badge of the regulation size, with the
royal crown and silver greyhound pendent, suspended
from the neck by a dark-blue ribbon. This
uniform, and more especially the badge, must be
always worn by Messengers when travelling; but
the badge must not be worn at any other time.’</p>

<p>We have said nothing of home Messengers, those
who carry despatches to and fro within the limits
of the British Islands. Nor indeed is there much to
say concerning them. They are fewer in number,
and less handsomely paid than those employed
abroad. Under the system which prevailed before
the reforms effected eight or nine years ago, each
home Messenger had quite a medley of emoluments‒so
much fixed salary, so much board wages, so
much excess or surplus above actual travelling
expenses of all kinds. This is now altered; each
Messenger receives a definite annual remuneration
for his services‒less than formerly, but quite
sufficient for the kind of work done. In fact
postal facilities and the electric telegraph are
gradually lessening the necessity for the adoption
of the Messenger system. Nevertheless there are
times when a home Messenger is thrown upon his
own resources. When the Queen is at Balmoral,
and floods and snow-storms block the railways and
render the roads impassable, the Messenger must
perforce get on somehow or other with his despatch
bag, at any cost of money, toil, and anxiety; and
he <em>does</em> get on, although the newspapers are not
told much about it.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.‒IN THE WASTE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Wednesday, a half-holiday at the village
school of High Tor, and the work of learning and
the yet harder toil of teaching were for that day
over. Ethel Gray had seen the last of her released
pupils scamper joyously off homewards, and was
busied in putting away books and maps, when the
clatter of heavy shoes caused her to turn her eyes
towards the doorway, wherein stood a tall slip of
a girl, looking absurdly big and bony for the
clothes which she had outgrown. Ethel knew the
freckled face, and smiled pleasantly in answer to
its owner’s grin of recognition.</p>

<p>‘If you please, miss,’ said the new-comer,
sidling towards the school-mistress‒‘if you please,
mother sent I down from the moor to say how
’twas my little brother didn’t ’tend here nouther
Monday, nor yetterer Tuesday, nor now. Little
Lenny be down in the fever; that’s why he ben’t
here, please.’</p>

<p>‘What fever?’ asked Ethel. She had not been
long enough at High Tor to become thoroughly
familiar with the diction of the country folks.</p>

<p>‘<em>The</em> fever, to be sure!’ reiterated the tall girl,
who might have been some fourteen years of age,
amazed that so learned a personage as she took
Miss Gray to be should boggle over so patent a
physiological fact. ‘It do be going about most at
fall-time; but Lenny’s only a wishy one, ye know,
so he’s took with the shiver fits in June, getting
wet at the hayfield; and so, mother bein’ main fond
o’ he, as we ’m all, when he begs her to “let Miss
Gray, to school, know ’twarn’t his fault,” why
mother says: “Betty, get thee down to village and
do the child’s arrand.” That be all.’</p>

<p>The quick tears rose glistening to Ethel’s eyes.
There was something pathetic in the idea of this
tiny sufferer tossing on his bed of pain beneath
the rotting thatch of the cottage among the moorlands,
and anxious to excuse his involuntary
default to the kind teacher whom he had already
learned to love. He was a pet pupil of Ethel’s,
this wee boy Lenny, or Leonard Mudge by name,
as being one of those rare learners who seem to
thirst after the fountains of knowledge towards
which others have to be cajoled or driven. Day
after day had the new school-mistress seen Lenny
in class, the readiest to come, the least eager to
leave, his bright large eyes intent upon the face of
his instructress.</p>

<p>The parents had been proud of the little fellow’s
cleverness, and with an unselfishness not universal
in the poor and struggling class to which they
belonged, had contrived not merely to save the
school-pence that supplemented the government
grant, but to send the boy down under such
escort as could be found for him, day after day.
Now it was a carter, who would perch Lenny on
the shaft of his rough chariot; now a stalwart lass,
bent on earning her ninepence for a day’s hard
work at the washing-tub, and who allowed the
little scholar to trot by her side; sometimes a
mushroom-gatherer or gleaner of whortleberries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
from the waste, and who was not unwilling to
take temporary charge of Lenny. Sometimes, as a
great concession, Sister Betty would be spared from
weeding or cow-tending, to convoy Leonard, too
young to go alone, to High Tor. As for Betty
herself, she had been relegated, long ago in the bygone
days of her own short schooling, into the
category of unteachables. She was a good girl;
but two successive mistresses had given her up as
a hopeless dunce, long before Betty began to earn
two-thirds of her own living, and Ethel Gray to be
mistress of High Tor school.</p>

<p>‘I’ll go and see Lenny. It is a half-holiday for
me, you know, as well as for the children. How
far is it, Betty? But I’m sure it is not too far, for
I am a tolerable walker, if you will shew me
the way,’ said Ethel impulsively. Now this, as
Betty knew, was the very consummation which
her mother, whose perceptions had been for the
time sharpened by the stimulus of maternal love,
desired to bring about. The moorland lass was
not much of a diplomatist, but she was quite well
aware that to exaggerate the difficulties of an
enterprise is often to damp the spirits of those
who undertake it.</p>

<p>‘It’s not fur,’ said Betty argumentatively; ‘that’s
to say,’ she added, as her conscience smote her,
‘not to call fur, but a goodish walk. But ’tis
mortal fine to-day. And Lenny he’d be so glad!’</p>

<p>Ethel hesitated no longer, but merely mentioning
her errand to the decent old village dame who
was her housekeeper and factotum, threw her rain-cloak
over her arm‒no bad precaution in that
moist climate‒and under Betty’s guidance set
forth. As to the beauty of the day, Betty was
speaking within bounds when she described it as
‘mortal fine.’ The sparkling sky was as blue as
a sapphire, and the breeze balmy enough to have
blown over the orange groves and geranium hedges
of Bermuda. It was, in short, one of those so-called
‘gaudy’ mornings which rarely, in the uncertain
climate of our latitudes, finish as they have
begun; least of all among the wilds of savage
Dartmoor, the very cradle and nesting-place of
bad weather.</p>

<p>A long walk it was, over rough and smooth,
over wet and dry, by road and track of very
various quality, to the cluster of moorland cottages,
far off in an upland valley, where dwelt the
Mudge family. Betty knew the mileage pretty
well, but she kept the information to herself, lest,
as she said in her own heart, ‘school-mistress’
should be ‘scared.’ She had a very poor opinion
personally of the physical powers of book-learned
fellow-creatures; but when she found how well
her companion kept pace with her on the steep
hill-side, she paused once to say, with shy
approval: ‘’Tis yarely well ye walk, miss. We’ll
be there before long.’</p>

<p>A curiously contrasted pair would these two
have appeared, had any competent observer been
there to note the difference between them, as they
scaled the edges of the lofty table-land, gashed by
ravines and dotted by crags, which constitutes
Dartmoor. Betty’s personal appearance has been
mentioned. To say that a young female looks
lanky and gawky, may, however frequently such
adjectives are upon feminine lips, be thought to
imply some irreverence towards the sex. But it
would be impossible to conceive an accurate idea
of Betty Mudge without constructing an ideal
portrait of her that should depict her as gawky
and lanky, a large-boned, freckled, well-meaning
young creature, willingly accepting the responsibilities
of a life of hard work and contented
ignorance.</p>

<p>Ethel Gray, on the other hand, was a very
beautiful girl. Beauty, as we know, is independent
of its surroundings, and there is no reason
why a village schoolmistress should not possess
that dangerous gift. Her plain dress, her plain
little hat, could not hide the fact that her figure
was faultless, and that she possessed a lovely face
and hair that in its dark luxuriance deserved to be
called magnificent. What was more remarkable
was the sweet dignity of her manner, frank and
unpretending as it was. No one could be gentler
than Ethel. Children were at home with her at
once. But she seemed to be one of those who
are born to be respected, without advancing any
especial claim to consideration.</p>

<p>Lenny Mudge’s sister ought to have known
better than to have entered, with the rash confidence
of youth, on what was really five miles of
rough walking, on that most treacherous of days,
locally denominated as ‘spoiled,’ when a sunny
morning is succeeded by the oncoming of a mist as
dense as if it had boiled up from the sullen shores
of Cocytus or Acheron. The fog fell, as Dartmoor
fogs did fall before Britain saw the Roman eagles,
with the rapidity of a theatrical drop-scene cutting
off the mimic presentment from the clapping hands
and levelled opera-glasses of the spectators. Only
in this case it was stern reality.</p>

<p>‘Doan’t you be afeard, miss,’ said Betty sturdily;
‘I be moorland born and bred, and I’ll hammer
it out somehow.’</p>

<p>But this boast was more easy to make than
to fulfil, for everywhere hung, poised in air,
something like a silvery veil, shutting out from
sight all familiar landmarks, and rendering it
impossible to distinguish any object two paces
distant. The mist had fallen so abruptly from the
huge Tors, as it seemed, that rose here and there
like watch-towers of the waste, that a fanciful
imagination might have conceived the seething
vapour to represent a semi-transparent drapery,
suddenly cast from a giant hand over land and
sea.</p>

<p>But a minute or two before, Ethel had allowed
her eyes to rest admiringly on the many-coloured
surface of the vast moor, here robed in purple of
imperial splendour, there of tenderest green, and
anon brown or crimson or bluish gray, as shrub
and berry and weed and wild-flower dappled the
rolling ocean of heather. Then below was the
cultured plain, furrowed by thickly wooded clefts,
through which the Dartmoor streams ran brawling
to the sea, that lay calm and blue and flecked
with white sails, so plainly within the range of
vision. And now all was changed, and it was fog,
fog, and fog only, girdling in the wayfarers on
every hand, and there was no knowing whither to
turn.</p>

<p>Betty Mudge did her best; but her zeal outran
her discretion; and indeed the task of pilot in that
rolling mist was no easy one. Had there but
been a hard road, though never so narrow, beneath
her feet, the girl would have gone on cheerfully
enough. But there was no real road for about half
the distance between High Tor and Shaws, as that
solitary spot where stood the abode of the Mudges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
was called, merely a congeries of winding cart-ruts,
among which, in moderately clear weather, it was
facile for one who knew the country to make short-cuts
at pleasure.</p>

<p>‘If we were to go back?’ suggested Ethel, after
a while; but Betty Mudge by no means accepted the
proposition.</p>

<p>‘It be just as easy, miss, to go forrard as to go
backarder,’ returned Lenny’s sister doggedly; ‘but
what’s main hard in the thick is to know which
is which.’</p>

<p>They went on for some time without speaking.</p>

<p>‘I was listening,’ at last said the young guide
abruptly, ‘for a sheep-bell. If I could but hear
that, shepherd would put us right.’</p>

<p>But though Ethel hearkened also, in hopes of
catching the far-off tinkle of a bell from some
folded flock, the silence remained as unbroken as
though man, with all his works and ways, had
been banished from the island. Nothing but
blinding mist to greet the eye, nothing but heather
and peat and stones beneath the feet, as the two
stumbled and groped forward, going deeper and
deeper, for aught they knew, into the heart of the
wilderness. The misty vapour heaved and rolled
like a billowy sea, taking fantastic shapes, here of
a threatening giant, there of a winding-sheet
spread by no mortal hand, there again of a battlemented
castle rearing its towers aloft.</p>

<p>There are landscape painters‒even aspiring
young Associates, newly elected, of the Royal
Academy‒whom it would have greatly gratified
to have been on the moor that day, and to have
seen the fluctuating hues of the mist, here fleecy
snow, there translucent silver, elsewhere such
pearly grays as the colour-box fails to render,
while sunwards a faint pale shimmering streak of
tender opal stretched, like Jacob’s ladder, almost
from heaven to earth. It was a study worthy of
an artist’s heed too, the manner in which the bare
bleak Tors, red, brown, gray, according to the
nature of the stone, cropped up from the moor,
each crag rising out of the peaty soil like the
bones of a buried Titan. But poor Ethel became
very tired as she wandered on under the aimless
guidance of Betty Mudge, who was herself tired,
and who could but guess, and that wildly, in
which direction home might lie.</p>

<p>‘Ware!’ she cried, as Ethel was about to plant
her foot unsuspectingly on an inviting patch of
emerald turf. ‘Yon’s bog, yon is, deep enow to
suck down a horse to the saddle-laps. Never trust
the green, and the greener the softer, miss. Send,
we moun’t a strayed to Heronsmere or the Blackpool,
for there be swamps there would swallow
bigger nor we. Gran’father, they tell, smouthered
in Blackpool, but ’twere in winter-time.’</p>

<p>Then there came creeping like insidious enemies
into Ethel’s mind all the weird legends which
since her stay at High Tor she had heard regarding
the waste. There were tales of belated horsemen
and lonely foot-travellers overwhelmed by snow-storms
in winter, and lying dead among the drifts,
the prey of the hill-fox and the carrion crow.
There were tales too of those who had been lost
in the blinding mist, and had either perished in
some quagmire, or died miserably of hardship and
exhaustion, after many hours of walking on the
moor.</p>

<p>‘It ben’t of no manner o’ good!’ said Betty,
after another long spell of silence. ‘We may
walk till we drop. I’m main tired myself. And
what’s the use? For oughter we know, we may
be going round and round.’</p>

<p>Ethel too was weary, so weary that it was with
difficulty she could raise her voice to urge on her
now desponding companion the expediency of
a renewed effort. ‘Surely, surely,’ she said, ‘we
shall, if we persevere, come upon some road or
see the lights‒for it must be getting late‒in some
farm or cottage.’</p>

<p>‘One Tor be terrible like another,’ returned
Betty with a sob. ‘I got no more notion whirrabouts
we be, nor if I were fresh dropped out of
the moon. I’m no use here, and can hardly drag.
And what’ll mother say!’</p>

<p>And the girl sat down on a fragment of rock
which jutted from a bluff stony Tor rising overhead,
and began to weep. And then there forced
itself on Ethel’s mind the dreadful thought that
they had perhaps really been walking in a circle
until their forces were spent, and might die of
fatigue, cold, and even hunger before they should
be discovered. Who could tell when the fog
would disperse! The mist might overhang the
lofty table-land of the moor for whole days,
possibly for weeks, cutting the lost ones as completely
off from succour as some shipwrecked
mariner on his desolate isle. No sound floated to
Ethel’s ears as she listened long and eagerly.</p>

<p>‘Don’t cry, Betty; don’t cry. Something‒I
know not what‒tells me that we shall get through
this safely yet,’ said Ethel, as she too took her seat
upon the rock, and laid her hand kindly on that
of her young companion. But Betty only blubbered
the more furiously.</p>

<p>‘’Tain’t so much for me, miss!’ she said. ‘It
be my fault, every bit on’t. I brought you here.
And Lenny‒and mother’‒‒ The train of ideas
thus conjured up acted so strongly on the untutored
imagination of Betty Mudge, that she wept
so loudly and dolefully that her wails re-echoed
through the solitary waste.</p>

<p>What was that? Surely a human voice calling
aloud at some distance through the fog, as if in
answer to Betty’s inarticulate plaint. Yes, there
was no mistake this time. It was the hearty
halloo of a deep voice, and the words were: ‘Ho!
I say, there! What ails you? Anything wrong?’</p>

<p>‘We be lost in fog!’ called out the girl by way
of answer.</p>

<p>‘It’s a woman or a child,’ exclaimed another
voice from the mist. ‘Push on, Bates! The cry
came from this direction to the left.’ And presently,
bursting through the floating wreaths of
vapour, appeared the figures of two men, the
shorter and sturdier of whom, a gamekeeper by
his velveteen coat and leathern gaiters, and the
metal dog-whistle at his button-hole, led a pony
with a creel strapped to the saddle-bow.</p>

<p>‘Here they are, my Lord!’ ejaculated this
functionary, as he caught sight of the forlorn two
upon the rock. The gentleman to whom he spoke
came hurrying up across the stony ground, a
fishing-rod in his hand.</p>

<p>‘Don’t be frightened, my little maid,’ he called
out cheerily to Betty, who wept more unrestrainedly
than ever, now that help was near;
and then, catching a glimpse of Ethel’s pale
beautiful face as she looked up, he exclaimed:
‘Why, this is a lady‒here!’ and instinctively
he raised his hat. ‘Stop! It is Miss Gray from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
the village, if I am not mistaken.‒You must
let me see you safely off the moor. I live near,
at High Tor; though I daresay you do not know
me, Miss Gray. I have seen you at church.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I know you, Lord Harrogate,’ returned
Ethel, trying to rise, but sinking back fainting
and giddy on her rocky seat. ‘I am sorry to give
you trouble, but’‒‒ Her voice failed her, and
her eyes seemed to be darkened. The quick revulsion
of feeling, from what was all but sheer
despair to the consciousness of being saved, had
intensified the effects of great physical fatigue.
She heard the young man’s voice addressing herself,
but could not distinguish the words because
of the low droning sound that filled her ears
as she sat passive on the rock. Who he was
she quite well knew. It was not possible for the
member of a small congregation such as that
in High Tor church to be ignorant of the features
of so notable an occupant of Lord Wolverhampton’s
pew as the Earl’s son and heir. Tall, handsome,
and manly, Lord Harrogate was worth
looking at for his own sake; but Ethel had never
thus looked upon him until she found herself
thus confronted with him in the mist, as her
rescuer from certain suffering, perhaps from death.</p>

<p>‘If you are able to walk, Miss Gray,’ said Lord
Harrogate earnestly, ‘will you take my arm and
lean on me? My servant will charge himself with
the child here; indeed I do not think he can
do better than to set her on the pony, as she
seems so tired. We must all of us rely on Bates’s
guidance to get clear of the waste. Happily, he
is a thorough moorman, and can pick his way
where I should be at fault.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, ay, my Lord,’ returned Bates, flattered
by the compliment, but honestly unwilling to
be pranked in borrowed plumage. ‘But if we
were t’ other side o’ Pinkney Ridge or Cranmere
way, I’d not be so gey ready to take the lead in
a fog like this one. I’ve heard of moormen straying
round and round, and lying down to die
in a drift within gunshot o’ their own house-door.
But we were on the hard path just now,
so if we can but strike it again, we’re safe.’</p>

<p>They started, Betty Mudge perched sideways
on the pony, which the keeper led; while Ethel,
in spite of her protestation that she could walk
unaided, was glad to avail herself of the support
of Lord Harrogate’s arm. It was not all plain
sailing, for so dense was the fog that even the
experienced keeper was puzzled for a time, until
his sharp ear caught the well-known babble of
a brook.</p>

<p>‘’Tis running water!’ cried Bates in triumph.
‘Safest plan on the moor is to follow running
water, for that won’t deceive. We’ll win through
it.’</p>

<p>And indeed a short half-hour brought the party
to the firm high-road, with the gates of High Tor
Park, topped by their stone wyverns, within sight.
Betty Mudge, who announced herself as having an
aunt in the village at whose cottage she could
pass the night, was despatched under convoy
to that relative’s abode. But Ethel Grey looked
so worn and ill, that Lord Harrogate insisted on
her retaining his arm up the carriage-drive leading
to the house, where she could receive the attention
her state required.</p>

<p>‘My mother and sisters will take care of you,
I know,’ he said, as he supported her slow steps
through the park, where the fog, so dense upon
the frowning hills above, only floated in fitful
wreaths. The house was reached, and great was
the surprise of those within when Lord Harrogate
appeared with Ethel, pale, patient, exhausted, but
beautiful still, her dark hair and her dress dripping
with wet, leaning on his strong arm. The
Countess was kind; and her daughters, beautiful
golden-haired Lady Gladys, honest-eyed earnest
Lady Maud, even Lady Alice, a clever child of
twelve, were still more kind. A bright wood-fire
was soon blazing in what was called the
Yellow Room; and Ethel, seated as near to the
crackling logs as her chair could be placed, and
propped up with cushions, was able to dry her
wet tresses and drenched garments; while Lord
Harrogate’s sisters, and Lady Maud in especial,
pressed her to partake of tea and other refreshments,
and spoke soothingly to her, and were
very full of tender womanly sympathy.</p>

<p>Lady Maud, the Earl’s second daughter, knew
the new school-mistress better than did the others,
and liked her. She was herself a constant visitor
at the school-house, and had heard many and many
an urchin stammer through his or her lessons
there, and could therefore the better appreciate
the motive which had led Ethel into her late
danger, through a natural wish to comfort little
Lenny on his bed of fever. Warmth, and that
kindliness of manner which women shew more
than we do, did much towards bringing Ethel back
from that death-in-life which excessive fatigue and
chill tend to produce; and when the carriage was,
in spite of her remonstrance, ‘ordered round,’ to
convey her home to the school, she had strength
enough to walk unaided to the door. Lord Harrogate
had disappeared. The Earl had not as yet
returned from some meeting of magistrates. ‘I
will come down to see you, Miss Gray, to-morrow,
if I can,’ said Lady Maud, as the carriage
drove off.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VI.‒SIR SYKES MAKES AN
ANNOUNCEMENT.</h3>

<p>‘Lucy, my dear, and Blanche too, I want to
know how you would like to receive here, at
Carbery, a young lady who is a total stranger to
all of us; but who, if she comes at all, comes with
a distinct understanding that this house, until she
marries, is her home. I ask you this, my dears,
because I have received a letter’‒and the baronet
pointed to a black-bordered envelope that lay,
with others, beside his plate‒‘inclosing one
penned, long ago, by a hand which can write no
more. George Willis‒Major, when he died, in
the Indian army‒was one of my earliest and
truest friends. He is dead now. He left behind
him this one girl, his only and motherless child,
and‒and he begs me, in a letter, indorsed “After
my death to be forwarded to Sir Sykes Denzil,”
to become the guardian of this‒this poor orphaned
thing. How do you say, my girls? Shall we
have her here at Carbery, or not?’</p>

<p>It was very neatly and prettily put on the part
of Sir Sykes, and the appeal was all the more
effective because of the quietude and cool indifference
of the baronet’s ordinary manner. He was
a cold, unemotional person, in the everyday
routine of life; and hence the quivering of his
lips, the faltering of his voice, added much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
pathos to what might otherwise have seemed
commonplace.</p>

<p>As for the answer to the question asked, could
there be a doubt of it! It is to the credit of a
woman’s heart that it always, when a plea is well
urged, responds to the Open Sesamé of compassion.
They may not, as men do, seek out hidden wrongs
to be righted and unseen pangs to be assuaged.
But the distress that lies at their door they seek
to comfort; and had the young ladies of Carbery
been very much poorer than they were, their reply
to their father’s question would have been as
generously outspoken.</p>

<p>‘By all means, yes, papa, let us have the poor
girl here‒this Miss‒Willis I think is her name;
and we will try to make her happy. How sad!’
And Blanche and Lucy were all but in tears
over the woes of this Anglo-Indian orphan; while
Jasper, hiding his face behind his coffee-cup,
reflected that ‘the governor’ was a cool hand,
and did his little bit of acting in a manner worthy
of Barnum himself.</p>

<p>In most houses of sufficient dignity to own a
special letter-bag, the temporary office of post-master
is publicly discharged. The old Earl of
Wolverhampton, for instance, found it pleasant
to sort and classify the motley mass of correspondence
which came daily to High Tor; but
he would almost as soon have opened a servant’s
letter as have opened the bag otherwise than in
the presence of guests and kindred. Carbery
Chase, however, was not High Tor, and Sir
Sykes Denzil was a very different family chief
from his noble neighbour. The baronet was an
early riser, as are many men who have spent much
of their lives in India; and he chose that the
post-bag should be brought to him in the library
an hour or so before the usual assembling for
breakfast. Jasper, who was of a suspicious temper,
resented this exercise of parental authority; but he
was wrong. There may have been passages in Sir
Sykes’s life which would not, if published, have
redounded to his credit, but tampering with letters
was not congenial to him. He never gave a second
glance to any envelope addressed to Captain Denzil
or the captain’s sisters, and was as loyal a custodian
of the family correspondence as any gentleman
in the whole county of Devon. There was this
advantage in the baronet’s habit as regarded the
post-bag, that nobody could tell what letters Sir
Sykes received or when he did receive them.
There are many of us, and those not the least loved
or esteemed, whose letters are as it were public
property, and with whom reticence on the subject
of a missive newly received by the post would
diffuse disquiet and perhaps dismay through the
domestic circle. Sir Sykes had never been one of
those who wear their hearts, metaphorically, on
their sleeves; he told those around him as much
as he wished them to know, and no more.</p>

<p>There was quite a flutter of pleasurable excitement
among the Denzil girls at the prospect of a
new member of the household, a new face at Carbery.
They were sorry for this poor Miss Willis,
sorrier for her by far than for the many orphans
whose bereavement is notified to us every day by
a grim list of deaths dryly chronicled in the newspaper.
And they felt doubly disposed to welcome
her and be good to her in that she was lonely and
sad, and that her presence would introduce a new
element into Carbery. They made no sacrifice in
giving a cheerful acquiescence to their father’s
suggestion that his ward should be received beneath
his roof. In such a house the maintenance of an
extra inmate was of no moment at all. But had
Sir Sykes been living in furnished lodgings, and
forced to look twice at half-a-crown, those honest
girls would still not have grudged a share of their
hashed mutton and scanty house-room to the
daughter of an old friend of their father’s.</p>

<p>‘I don’t think, sir, that I remember to have
heard you mention the Major’s name,’ said Jasper,
stolidly buttering his toast, but furtively eyeing
his father from beneath his pale eyelashes.</p>

<p>‘I think you have heard it,’ answered Sir
Sykes, with a self-possession that all but staggered
Jasper’s unbelief. ‘We were quartered together
for years at Allahabad, Cawnpore, and Lahore.
There were Reynolds and L’Estrange, and Moreton
who is living yet, and this poor fellow Willis; the
old set, with whom I was intimate. I don’t often
bore listeners who have never been in India, with
the details of my eastern experiences, else I think
that the name of Major‒or Captain‒George
Willis would be tolerably familiar here.’</p>

<p>That the girls, in their newly awakened interest,
should ask questions was but natural. But their
father had not very much beyond the substance
of his original announcement to communicate.
He had, he said, but a vague recollection of Mrs
Willis, his friend’s wife, a bride when Sir Sykes
returned to Europe, and who had now been dead
for some years. She was a quiet domestic little
person, from Wales or Ireland, the baronet did not
know which; and she had some pittance of annual
income, which would no doubt go to her child
at the husband’s decease. Major Willis had no
private means, at least so Sir Sykes thought.
There was a London lawyer, however, who knew
all about the financial affairs of the orphan, and
who would of course render a proper statement to
the baronet’s solicitors. Miss Willis would be
entitled, as the child of an Indian officer, to no
pension, being, as Sir Sykes understood, over the
age of twenty-one; but of that again he was not
sure, not being certain of the exact age of his
friend’s daughter. She had no very near relatives,
and had never, to Sir Sykes’s knowledge, been in
England before.</p>

<p>‘It was the chaplain of the military station who
wrote,’ continued Sir Sykes, ‘inclosing in his letter
that which poor Willis had left for myself; and
unless I telegraph to veto the arrangement, you
are likely to see Miss Ruth‒did I say that her
name was Ruth‒very soon, since she is to start
by the next mail from Bombay.’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ muttered Jasper to himself, as some time
later in the morning he sauntered through the
plantations, the path across which made a short
cut from Carbery Chase to Lord Wolverhampton’s
park at High Tor, ‘I have seen some cool hands;
but‒‒ Well, well! It was neatly done, very
neatly. If the governor had not had the rare
luck to come into a fortune, he would have been
as fit to make one as any man I ever came across.’</p>

<p>The young man, whose preference for crooked
ways was congenital, and who knew of no road to
Fortune’s temple save miry and devious ones,
began really to feel an admiration for his father’s
abilities, since he had discovered to what profound
depths of dissimulation the baronet could descend.
His own craft had enabled him to lift a corner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
the fair seeming mask which Sir Sykes wore before
the world, but as yet his knowledge was too imperfect
to enable its possessor to make capital of the
secret. Could he once‒‒</p>

<p>‘Why, Captain Denzil!’ exclaimed a ringing
girlish voice, ‘I could almost give you credit for
poetic reveries, so complete is your unconsciousness
of the mere commonplace world around you.
You had all but passed us without a word or a
bow.’</p>

<p>Jasper could not repress a slight start, as he
found himself in presence of the three Ladies De
Vere and of their brother Lord Harrogate, in
the main avenue of the park. The young man’s
moody countenance brightened at once.</p>

<p>‘I am not, as a rule, greatly given to dreaming
in broad daylight, Lady Gladys,’ he said good-humouredly;
‘and as for the poetry, I’ll promise
to dedicate my first volume of sonnets, or whatever
they call them, to yourself. I am afraid, though,
you will have to wait a little before I take a
plunge into literature.’</p>

<p>‘Of books‒of a sort, you have been rather a
diligent compiler,’ said Lord Harrogate, smiling.</p>

<p>Jasper bit his lip; but it was in a careless tone
that he rejoined: ‘That’s only too true; but let
me tell you, Harrogate, there goes more of hard
thinking to the composition of a betting-book than
people usually suppose.‒I was on my way to the
house, meaning to inflict a little of my dullness
on you, Lady Maud, but you are early abroad.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; and you may as well walk down with us,’
said Lady Maud. ‘We are going to the school,
to see how my friend, Miss Gray, the school-mistress,
fares after her moorland adventure of
Saturday. You heard of it, Captain Denzil?’</p>

<p>No; Jasper had not heard of it. And on receiving
an account of it from Lady Maud’s lips, the
captain said, with never so little of a sneer, that
the episode was ‘quite romantic.’</p>

<p>‘Come and see the heroine of it,’ said bright-eyed
Lady Gladys; ‘and you who affect to admire
nothing, will be compelled to admit that you have
seen a face such as we very seldom behold except
in a picture.’</p>

<p>The party walked on together thus chatting
until they reached the village. The young people
of the two great houses, High Tor and Carbery
Chase, had naturally been well acquainted with
one another from an early period; and the two
elder of the De Vere girls were disposed to pity
Jasper rather than to blame him for the recklessness
that had brought about his exile from the
haunts of fashion. But the captain knew that
Lord Harrogate and he were uncongenial spirits.
He did not like Harrogate, and he had a shrewd
idea that Harrogate despised him. We cannot,
however, be very eclectic in the depths of the
country as regards those with whom we associate,
and hence these two young men, of natures so
dissimilar, tolerated one another because of the
ancient friendship existing between their families.</p>

<p>The school was reached, and Ethel its mistress,
still pale, but lovely as one of the white roses in
her tiny garden, came forward to receive her distinguished
visitors, and paid her tribute of thanks
to Lord Harrogate for the service he had rendered
her, with a modest grace which was all the more
charming from its extreme simplicity of words and
manner.</p>

<p>‘I was too weak and faint the other evening,
my Lord, to say what I felt as to your‒your great
kindness.’</p>

<p>And a princess could not have spoken better.
It was Lord Harrogate who seemed embarrassed,
as your honest Briton, gentle or simple, is embarrassed
by being thanked. And then, while Lady
Maud eagerly told how jelly and hothouse fruit
and port wine had been despatched from High
Tor to the moorland cottage for the benefit of
little Lenny Mudge, and how the parish doctor
spoke hopefully of his small patient, Jasper looked
at Ethel Gray with a sort of wonder, as at the most
beautiful woman that he had ever seen, and the
most thoroughly a lady, not even excepting Lady
Gladys De Vere. But he said nothing, and lounged
carelessly off with the party when adieus had been

<h2><a name="STORY_OF_CAPTAIN_GLASS" id="STORY_OF_CAPTAIN_GLASS">STORY OF CAPTAIN GLASS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">About</span> the time of the accession of George III. to
the throne, few domestic events made a greater
sensation in the papers and periodicals of the day
than the adventures and fate of a sea-captain
named George Glass, especially in connection with
a mutiny on board the brig <em>Earl of Sandwich</em>.
This remarkable man, who was one of fifteen
children of John Glass, noted as the originator of
the Scottish sect known as the Glassites, was born
at Dundee in 1725. After graduating in the medical
profession, he made several voyages, as surgeon
of a merchant-ship (belonging to London), to
the Brazils and the coast of Guinea; and in 1764,
he published, by Dodsley, an interesting work in
one volume quarto, entitled <cite>The History of the
Discovery and Conquest of the Canary Islands,
translated from a Spanish manuscript</cite>.</p>

<p>He obtained command of a Guinea trader, and
made several successful voyages, till the war with
Spain broke out in January 1762. Having saved
a good round sum, he equipped a privateer, and
took command of her as captain, to cruise against
the French and Spaniards; but he had not been
three days at sea, when his crew mutinied, and
sent him that which is called in sea-phraseology a
round-robin (a corruption of an old French military
term, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ruban rond</i>, or round ribbon), in
which they wrote their names in a circle; hence
none could know who was the leader.</p>

<p>Arming himself with his cutlass and pistols,
Glass came on deck, and offered to fight, hand
to hand, any man who conceived himself to be
wronged in any way. But the crew, knowing his
personal strength, his skill and resolution, declined
the challenge. He succeeded in pacifying them
by fair words; and the capture of a valuable French
merchantman a few days after put them all in
excellent humour. This gleam of good fortune
was soon after clouded by an encounter with an
enemy’s frigate, which though twice the size of
his privateer, Glass resolved to engage; and for
two hours they fought broadside to broadside, till
another French vessel bore down on him, and he
was compelled to strike his colours, after half
his crew had been killed and he had received a
musket-shot in the shoulder.</p>

<p>He remained for some time a French prisoner of
war in the Antilles, where he was treated with
excessive severity; but upon being exchanged, he
resolved to embark the remainder of his fortune in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
another privateer, and ‘have it out,’ as he said,
with the French and Dons. But he was again
taken in action, and lost everything he had in the
world.</p>

<p>On being released a second time, he was employed
by London merchants in several voyages
to the West Indies, in command of ships that
fought their way without convoy; and according
to a statement in the <cite>Annual Register</cite>, he was captured
no less than <em>seven</em> times. But after various
fluctuations of fortune, when the general peace
took place in 1763, he found himself possessed of
two thousand guineas prize-money, with the reputation
of being one of the best merchant captains
in the Port of London.</p>

<p>About that time, a Company there resolved to
make an attempt to form a settlement on the west
coast of Africa, by founding a harbour and town
midway between the Cape de Verd and the river
Senegal. In the London and other papers of the
day we find many statements urging the advantage
of opening up the Guinea-trade; among
others, a strange letter from a merchant, who tells
us he was taken prisoner in a battle on that coast,
and that when escaping he ‘crossed a forest within
view of the sea, where there lay elephants’ teeth
in quantities sufficient to load one hundred
ships.’</p>

<p>In the interests of this new Company Glass
sailed in a ship of his own to the coast of Guinea,
and selected and surveyed a harbour at a place
which he was certain might become the centre of
a great trade in teak and cam woods, spices, palm
oil and ivory, wax and gold. Elated with his success,
he returned to England, and laid his scheme
before the ministry, among whom were John Earl
of Sandwich, Secretary of State, and the Earl of
Hillsborough, Commissioner of Trade and Plantations.</p>

<p>With truly national patience and perseverance,
he underwent all the procrastination and delays of
office, but ultimately obtained an exclusive right
of trading to his own harbour for twenty years.
Assisted by two merchants‒the Company would
seem to have failed‒he fitted out his ship anew,
and sailed for the intended harbour; and sent on
shore a man who knew the country well, to make
propositions of trade with the natives, who put
him to death the moment they saw him.</p>

<p>Undiscouraged by this event, Captain Glass
found means to open up a communication with
the king of the country, to lay before him the
wrong that had been done, and the advantages
that were certain to accrue from mutual trade and
barter. The sable potentate affected to be pleased
with the proposal, but only to the end that he
might get Glass completely into his power; but
the Scotsman was on his guard, and foiled him.</p>

<p>The king then attempted to poison the whole
crew by provisions which he sent on board impregnated
by some deadly drug. Glass, by his previous
medical knowledge perhaps, discovered this in
time; but so scarce had food become in his vessel,
that he was compelled to go with a few hands in
an open boat to the Canaries, where he hoped
to purchase what he wanted from the Spaniards.</p>

<p>In his absence the savages were encouraged to
attack the ship in their war-canoes; but were
repulsed by a sharp musketry-fire opened upon
them by the remainder of the crew, who losing
heart by the protracted absence of the captain,
quitted his fatal harbour, and sailed for the
Thames, which they reached in safety.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the unfortunate captain, after landing
on one of the Canaries, presented a petition to the
Spanish governor to the effect that he might be
permitted to purchase food; but that officer, inflamed
by national animosity, cruelly threw him
into a dark and damp dungeon, and kept him there
without pen, ink, or paper, on the accusation that
he was a spy. Being thus utterly without means
of making his case known, he contrived another
way of communicating with the external world.
One account has it that he concealed a pencilled
note in a loaf of bread which fell into the hands
of the British consul; another states that he wrote
with a piece of charcoal on a ship-biscuit and
sent it to the captain of a British man-of-war that
was lying off the island, and who with much
difficulty, and after being imprisoned himself,
effected the release of Glass. The latter, on being
joined by his wife and daughter, who had come in
search of him, set sail for England in 1765, on
board the merchant brig <em>Earl of Sandwich</em>, Captain
Cochrane.</p>

<p>Glass doubtless supposed his troubles were now
over; but the knowledge that much of his property
and a great amount of specie, one hundred
thousand pounds, belonging to others, was on
board, induced four of the crew to form a conspiracy
to murder every one else and seize the
ship. These mutineers were respectively George
Gidley, the cook, a native of the west of England;
Peter M’Kulie, an Irishman; Andrew Zekerman,
a Hollander; and Richard H. Quintin, a Londoner.
On three different nights they are stated to have
made the attempt, but were baffled by the vigilance
of Captain Glass, rather than that of his countryman,
Captain Cochrane; but at eleven o’clock at
night on the 30th of November 1765, it chanced,
as shewn at their trial, that these four miscreants
had together the watch on deck, when the <em>Sandwich</em>
was already in sight of the coast of Ireland;
and when Captain Cochrane, after taking a
survey aloft, was about to return to the cabin,
Peter M’Kulie brained him with ‘an iron bar’
(probably a marline-spike), and threw him overboard.</p>

<p>A cry that had escaped Cochrane alarmed the
rest of the crew, who were all despatched in the
same manner as they rushed on deck in succession.
This slaughter and the din it occasioned roused
Captain Glass, who was below in bed; but he
soon discovered what was occurring, and after
giving one glance on deck, rushed away to get his
sword. M’Kulie imagining the cause of his going
back, went down the steps leading to the cabin,
and stood in the dark, expecting Glass’s return,
and suddenly seized his arms from behind; but
the captain being a man of great strength,
wrenched his sword-arm free, and on being assailed
by the other three assassins, plunged his weapon
into the arm of Zekerman, when the blade became
wedged or entangled. It was at length wrenched
forth, and Glass was slain by repeated stabs of his
own weapon, while his dying cries were heard by
his wife and daughter‒two unhappy beings who
were ruthlessly thrown overboard and drowned.</p>

<p>Besides these four victims, James Pincent, the
mate, and three others lost their lives. The
mutineers now loaded one of the boats with the
money, chests, and so forth, and then scuttled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
<em>Sandwich</em>, and landed at Ross on the coast of
Ireland. But suspicion speedily attached to them;
they were apprehended; and confessing the crimes
of which they had been guilty, were tried before
the Court of King’s Bench, Dublin, and sentenced
to death. They were accordingly executed in St
Stephen’s Green, on the 10th of October 1765.</p>

<h2><a name="AN_EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY_ROMANCE" id="AN_EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY_ROMANCE">AN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ROMANCE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> a bright cold day in April 1719, a travelling
carriage with three postillions dashed, full of the
importance which always attends a fashionable well-built
vehicle, into the famous but not progressive
town of Innsbruck. The carriage contained four
persons, said to be going to Loretto on pilgrimage‒the
Comte and Comtesse de Cernes,
with the brother and sister of the comtesse; and
as the aristocratic party alighted at their hotel,
they created some sensation among those who clustered
round the porch in the clear sharp twilight.
The comtesse and her sister were very much enveloped
in furs, and wore travelling masks, which
effectually screened their faces from the vulgar
gaze, and diverted the curiosity of the homely
Tyrolese to the undisguised figures of the comte
and the comtesse’s brother. The former was the
statelier of the two, but the latter was universally
pronounced to be <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ein herrlicher Mensch</i>.
There was a certain sprightly grace in his movements
which yet did not detract from the dignity
essential in those days to a gentleman, and which
would have saved him from being addressed with
too great familiarity. The news soon circulated
among the loungers that the fresh arrivals were
Flemings; and the pleasant blue eyes of the
comte and his brother-in-law‒though certainly
not the sprightly grace of the latter‒accorded
with these floating accounts of their origin.</p>

<p>The pretty Tyrolese hostess, whose face was so
charmingly set off by the trim smartness of her
velvet bodice and scarlet petticoat, together with
various silver chains, gleefully returned to her
parlour and her burly good-tempered husband,
after attending the ladies to their apartments.
She had seen the Comtesse de Cernes without
her furs and travelling mask, dressed in lilac
camlet turned up with silk; so handsome, so
gracious, so talkative, that the hostess thought
she must be French; for the hostess had seen
plenty of French people before now, besides
Flemings. The comtesse was dark-haired and
dark-eyed; her sister, who had also divested herself
of her mask, did not equal her in appearance.
Every one at the inn was glad that the amiable
party from Flanders were going to rest there four
days.</p>

<p>Their supper was ordered in a private room,
where the host and hostess waited on them in
person, and consequently had the best of it with the
loungers afterwards. The two gentlemen were in
good spirits, and the hostess thought their talk
none the less amusing for being in a language
which she did not understand. Their laughing
looks and easy action conveyed to her mind a
sufficient sense of fun to make her fair face shine
placidly in sympathy. Altogether they were the
liveliest Flemings she had ever seen; and their
good-humour seemed to be shared by the three
postillions, two of whom were Walloons and one
Italian, and who were making themselves very
popular among the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitués</i> of the inn.</p>

<p>‘Well, this is a pleasant little town of yours,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mes amis</i>,’ said the vivacious Walloon outrider, who
contrasted strikingly with his great, tall, quietly
smiling companion. ‘One could die of ennui here
as well as at Liege.’</p>

<p>‘No, you could not,’ returned a long spare
poetic Tyrolese, who spent most of his evenings at
the inn, but never drank; notwithstanding which
peculiarity he and the host were warm friends.
‘We mountain-folk are not dull; our hills and
our torrents permit of no dullness.’</p>

<p>‘Very well perhaps for you who are born to it, to
hang by your eyelids on rocky ledges, or balance
yourselves over what are called in verses the silver
threads of waterfalls, in pursuit of an undoubtedly
clever and pretty little animal; but all that would
be dull work to us. And then you have not a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse</i>. What should we do without ours? There
would be no one to whom one could be postillion.’</p>

<p>‘We are our own <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse</i>,’ said the spare poetic
Tyrolese.</p>

<p>‘And you cannot say, Claude,’ observed the tall
Walloon, ‘that Innsbruck is without <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse</i> at the
present moment; nay more, it contains royalty in
the shape of two captive princesses!’</p>

<p>‘One of them the grand-daughter of the hero
who saved this empire from the Turks, for which
the Emperor now keeps her in durance.’</p>

<p>‘Take care, Monsieur,’ said the host (he pronounced
‘Monsieur’ execrably); ‘we are all the
Kaiser’s loyal subjects here in Tyrol.’</p>

<p>‘Pardon, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mein Wirth</i>,’ replied Claude, who pronounced
German as badly as the host did French.
‘You know we men who run about the world laugh
at everything, and too often let our tongues run
faster than our feet.’</p>

<p>‘And after all,’ observed the Italian, ‘it is
doing the young princess no bad turn to prevent
her marrying a prince out of place, who is not
likely to recover his situation.’</p>

<p>The Flemings spent the few days of their sojourn
at Innsbruck in visiting the churches and seeing
what was to be seen in the town. The Comtesse
de Cernes’s brother was the busiest of the party.
On the morning after his arrival he met in a
church porch a rather impish-looking boy in the
dress of a ‘long-haired page,’ and the two held a
brief colloquy. To this stylish page, in whom
the rather shapeless Slavonic type of countenance
was widened out by smiles of assurance, the gentleman
from Flanders delivered a letter, together
with a wonderful snuff-box, cut out of a single
turquoise, ‘for his mistress to look at.’ On the
three remaining days likewise the two met in
different spots; the boy restored the snuff-box,
and brought some letters written in a fashionable
pointed hand, in return for those with which the
Fleming had intrusted him.</p>

<p>The party were to set out on their southward
way at two o’clock on the morning of the 28th
of April. The evening of the 27th was overshadowed
by clouds, driven by a sharp north-east
wind. Notwithstanding the aspects of the
weather, the brother of the Comtesse de Cernes,
standing in the midst of his little party in their
private room, donned his cocked-hat and surtout.</p>

<p>‘Well, Wogan,’ said the comte, ‘if practice
makes perfect, you are a professor in the art of
effecting escapes. After having burst your way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
out of Newgate, and been valued at five hundred
English guineas (much below your worth of course),
and cooled yourself for some hours on the roof of a
London house, and reached France safely after all,
you ought to be able to abstract a young lady
from the careless custody of Heister and his
sentinels.’</p>

<p>‘I shall be ashamed if I fail, after wringing
from Prince Sobieski his consent to the attempt,
and after his giving me the Grand Vizier’s snuff-box;
but I always find that doing things for other
people is more difficult than doing them for one’s
self.’</p>

<p>‘I should say she was a clever girl,’ remarked
the comte, ‘and her page a clever page.’</p>

<p>‘I wonder if Jannetton is ready?’ said the
comtesse, retiring into the bedroom occupied by
the ladies, whence she soon emerged with her
sister, who wore her paletot, and was smiling
sufficiently to shew two rows of exquisitely white
teeth. The comtesse on the contrary seemed
somewhat affected. ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adieu, Jannetton, mais au
revoir.</i> There will be no danger to you, and the
Archduchess will take care that you join me in
Italy.’</p>

<p>Jannetton vowed she had no fears; and went
forth into the deepening twilight, being shortly
afterwards followed by the gentleman in cocked-hat
and surtout. Curiosity did not now dog the
Flemish pilgrims, as it had done while they were
altogether novelties, and the adventurers slipped
out unobserved. Meanwhile the ‘long-haired page’
was busy at one of the side-doors of the castle,
where he was often wont to converse with the
sentinel on duty.</p>

<p>‘I don’t envy you your trade, Martin,’ he said,
standing within the porch, to the hapless soldier
pacing up and down in the keen wind. ‘Glory is
one thing and comfort another; but after all, very
often no one hears of the glory, whereas the comfort
is a tangible benefit. With the wind in the
north-east and a snow-storm beginning, I at least
would rather be comfortable than glorious.’</p>

<p>‘A man who has seen campaigns thinks but
little of a snow-storm, Herr Konska.’</p>

<p>‘But they generally put you into winter-quarters,’
said Konska, not wishing the sentinel to pique
himself on his hardihood.</p>

<p>‘No matter; a soldier learns what hardship is.
I wish you could see a shot-and-shell storm instead
of a snow-storm, or a forest of bayonets poked into
your face by those demons of Irish in the French
service.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I say it is a shame not to treat you men
better who have braved all that. See here; there
is not even a sentry-box where you can nurse your
freezing feet. Ugh!’ And Konska withdrew, presumably
to warmer regions, while the soldier preserved
a heroic appearance as he paced shivering
on his narrow beat. But a few minutes later
Konska, stealing back to the door, saw that his
martial friend was no longer at his post. The
impish page pointed for a moment in ecstasy to
a tavern temptingly visible from the sentry’s
beat. Then he darted back in delight to whence
he came.</p>

<p>While the snow-clouds were gathering over
Innsbruck, and before the Flemish chevalier had
put on his surtout, two ladies conversed in low
tones in a chamber of the castle, of which General
Heister was then the commandant. Only one
lady was visible; rather elderly, very stately, and
somewhat careworn in appearance. But that the
other speaker was of gentle sex and rank might be
presumed from the tones of a voice which issued
from the closed curtains of the bed. It might even
be the voice of a young girl.</p>

<p>‘I hope you will not get into trouble, mamma,’
said the mysterious occupier of the bed.</p>

<p>‘Hardly, if you write a proper letter on the
subject of your departure, as the Chevalier Wogan
advises. You must cover my complicity by
begging my pardon.’</p>

<p>‘I am afraid you must write it yourself, mamma,
as I am <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</i>.’</p>

<p>‘That would not be to the purpose, my dear
child: the general would know my handwriting.
I will push a table up to you; no one will disturb
us now till your substitute comes.’ She carried a
light table, furnished with inkstand and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">papetière</i>
to the side of the bed, and made an aperture in
the curtains, whence emerged the rosy bright-eyed
face of a girl‒who certainly did not look the
invalid she otherwise appeared to be‒and a white
hand with an aristocratic network of blue veins.</p>

<p>‘Will that do, mamma?’ she asked, after covering
a page with writing equally elegant and difficult
to read. ‘Have I apologised and stated my
reasons for going, eloquently enough? Oh, how
I hope that I shall some day be a queen in my
own capital, and that you and papa will come and
live there!’</p>

<p>The mamma sighed, as swift imagination presented
to her mind all the obstacles to so glorious
a consummation; but she expressed herself well
satisfied with the letter, which she placed on the
toilet table. ‘I shall leave you now,’ she said;
‘you will find me in my room when you wish to
bid me farewell.’ She spoke with a certain stately
sadness as she left the apartment. The next
person who entered it was the Comtesse de
Cernes’s sister in her paletot, with a hood drawn
forward over her face. She only said: ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Que votre
Altesse me pardonne!</i>’ (Pardon me, your Highness.)</p>

<p>Instantly the curtains divided once more, and
the whole radiant vision of the mysterious invalid,
clad in a dressing-gown richly trimmed with
French lace, and shewing a face sparkling with
animation, sprang forth laughing: ‘You are the
substitute?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, your Highness!’</p>

<p>‘I am sure I thank you very heartily, as well as
Madame Misset and the Chevalier Wogan, and all
the kind and loyal friends who are taking so
much trouble for my consort and for me. The
Archduchess will take good care of you, Jannetton.’</p>

<p>Jannetton again shewed her teeth in a courtly
smile as she courtesied deeply. She was already
persuaded that she would be well cared for, in
reward for the mysterious services she had come
to render the captive lady. She disencumbered
herself of her paletot, and looked amazingly like
a very neat French waiting-maid until she had
bedizened herself in the young lady’s beautifully
worked dressing-gown. Then she speedily disappeared
behind the curtains of the bed; while the
invalid, wrapping herself in the paletot, rushed
into the next room to embrace with tears and smiles
her anxious mamma, who said but little, and was
now only eager to hurry her away. There too she
took possession of her page, and a small box which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
was to accompany her flight down the dark staircases.
‘Your Highness will find all safe,’ said the
solemn page, who was careful to suppress outer
signs of his innate roguishness in the presence of
his mistresses.</p>

<p>‘The sentinel will not know me?’ said the
young lady.</p>

<p>‘I am sure that he will not. Even if by chance
he should look out from the window of the tavern
where he is now ensconced, it is not very likely
that he would know your Highness.’</p>

<p>The black clouds which obscured the blueness
of the April night had broken forth into a lashing
storm of hail and wind before the young girl and
the page sallied forth into the darkness. She
could hardly keep her footing in the wet deserted
streets; her hood was blown back, and her fair
hair became dangerously visible; her paletot was
splashed with the mud thrown up by her tread,
and battered with hail; still she laughed at all
difficulties, for a hero’s blood flowed in her veins,
and now and then steadied herself by a touch on
the page’s shoulder as they floundered on. At the
corner of a street they suddenly came upon a dark
figure, whose first appearance as it crossed her path
caused the fugitive to start back in some alarm.
But it was only the Comtesse de Cernes’s brother;
and the young lady’s mind was relieved when with
a swift grace he bent for a moment over her hand
with the words: ‘My princess, soon to be my
sovereign, accept the homage, even in a dark street
and a hail-storm, of your loyal servant, Charles
Wogan.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, my protector and good angel! is it indeed
you?’ replied the young lady. ‘Be assured that
I would gladly go through many dark streets and
hail-storms to join my consort!’</p>

<p>And certainly this was a generous expression to
use concerning a consort whom she had never seen.
She and the Flemish chevalier were apparently
old friends; and he had soon conducted her to the
inn, which the page Konska, however, was not to
enter with his mistress; he was to wait in a
sheltered archway until the Comte de Cernes’s
travelling carriage should pick him up on its way
out of Innsbruck in the darkness of early morning.
With a grimace he departed for this covert, while
his mistress was hurried into the warm atmosphere
of the Comtesse de Cernes’s bedroom, where
that would-be Loretto pilgrim knelt and kissed
her hand. But better even than loyal kisses were
the bright wood-fire, the posset, and the dry
clothes which also awaited her in this room.</p>

<p>‘And you are Madame Misset, the noble Irish
lady of whom my good angel Wogan speaks in his
letters! How can I thank you for the trouble you
take for me! I regard him quite in the place of
my papa. But you all seem to be as good as he is!’</p>

<p>‘Madame,’ replied the lady thus addressed, with
all the loyalty of eighteenth-century speech, ‘your
Highness knows that it is a delight to a subject to
serve such a sovereign as our gracious prince; and
all that I have done is at my husband’s bidding.’</p>

<p>‘With such subjects, I am sure it will not be
long before he regains his throne. Ah, this delightful
fire! Do you know, Madame, it is snowing
and hailing outside as if it were January!’</p>

<p>If Madame Misset felt some concern at the
thought of the impending journey‒if not for her
own sake, at least for that of her husband, she
expressed none, except on her Highness’s account.
However, her Highness gaily laughed at hardship
and difficulty, and was not at all depressed at
having left her mother in the castle-prison.
Her only fear was that she should be missed from
the castle before she had got clear of Innsbruck.
But matters were too well arranged for so speedy a
termination of the romance. By two o’clock of
the windy spring morning the travelling carriage
was ready, the Tyrolese landlord and landlady
little suspecting, as they sped their parting guests,
that the second lady who entered it in cloak and
mask was any other than that sister of the Comtesse
de Cernes who had arrived four days before.</p>

<p>‘Oh, my good Papa Wogan!’ exclaimed the
latest addition to the party of pilgrims, as they
were rolled into the darkness of that wild night,
‘how delighted I am to be free again, and about to
join my royal consort! I owe more than I can
express to all, but most to you!’ Which she
might well say, seeing that it was ‘Papa Wogan’
who had selected her as the bride of this consort
to whom her devotion was so great. She chattered
brightly away, with the natural vivacity of eighteen
in an adventure, rejoicing in her new-found freedom
however cold it might be; and the only
clouded face in the carriage was that of the Comtesse
de Cernes. She was anxious on account of
the vivacious little man who had formerly been
postillion, and who was now riding far behind the
carriage with his tall companion, to keep at bay
possible couriers, who might soon be hurrying to
the border fortresses with news that a prisoner had
escaped the vigilance of General Heister at the
Castle of Innsbruck. The two gentlemen in the
carriage assured her that no harm would happen
to two such dashing cavaliers; but perhaps the
comtesse thought that to those who are safe it is
easy to talk of safety. Not that any of the party
were really safe, but the cheerfulness of the young
lady, whose passport was shewn at all the towns
as made out for the sister of the Comtesse de
Cernes, seemed to preclude the idea of peril to her
companions. At Venice the mind of the comtesse
was finally set at ease by the reappearance of the
outriders, telling a funny unscrupulous sort of
story about having fallen in on the road with a
courier from Innsbruck, to whom they made themselves
very agreeable, and whom they finally left
hopelessly tipsy at an inn near Trent.</p>

<p>‘It was very wrong of you, Messieurs,’ said the
escaped fugitive, ‘to make him drink so much;
you ought to have tied him up somewhere. But
I thank you very much for all the dangers you
incurred for my sake; and I assure all of you, my
good friends, that your king and queen will never
forget you.’</p>

<p>There were no telegrams in those days; but
before a week was over, all Europe, or rather all
political and fashionable Europe, was talking of
the escape of the Princess Clementina Sobieski,
grand-daughter of the hero who repulsed the
hordes of Turkey on the plains before Vienna,
from her captivity at the Castle of Innsbruck,
where she and her mother had‒for political reasons
connected with Great Britain‒been placed by
her cousin, the Emperor Charles VI. of Germany.
It was told with indignation at the courts of
London and Vienna, with laughter and admiration
at those of Rome, Paris, and Madrid, how she
had been carried off by a party of dashing Irish
people, calling themselves noble Flemish pilgrims;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
and how she had left a French maid-servant in her
place in the castle, and a letter to her mother
apologising for her flight. The prime contriver of
the adventure, it was said was that Chevalier
Wogan who had been in mischief for some time
past, and had made his own way with great <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aplomb</i>
out of Newgate.</p>

<p>At Venice, a singular readjustment of the dashing
party took place: the vivacious outrider now
appearing in the character of Captain Misset, the
husband of Madame Misset, hitherto called the
Comtesse de Cernes; and the tall outrider in that
of Captain O’Toole, both being of the Franco-Irish
regiment of Count Dillon, as was also the
gallant Major Gaydon, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alias</i> the Comte de Cernes.
The comtesse’s brother was now no longer related
to her, but acknowledged himself to be that Charles
Wogan who had really done much for the Chevalier,
having fought for him, been taken prisoner
for him, escaped for him, chosen his bride, and
effected her liberation as cleverly as he had
effected his own. In fact the Italian postillion
Vezzosi was the only one of this curious group
who had acted at all <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in propriâ personâ</i>.</p>

<p>The 15th of May 1719 was a gala day in Rome,
when a long string of coaches and the Prince‒whom
a large number of British subjects, expressing
their loyalty by peculiar signs of approval,
considered to be rightful king of Great Britain and
Ireland‒went out to conduct the fugitive young
lady triumphantly into the Eternal City. She
now no longer had need to use the passport which
franked her as the sister of the Comtesse de
Cernes, being openly and joyfully welcomed as
the Princess Maria Clementina Sobieski.</p>

<br />
SCIENCE AND ARTS.</h2>




<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1845 the late Professor Faraday delivered a
lecture on the solidification of gases at the Royal
Institution, and demonstrated his facts by experiments
as interesting as they were successful.
Under his skilful manipulation a tube filled with
olefiant gas, quite invisible, was seen to become
partially filled with a colourless liquid, which was
the gas in a condensed form. Two conditions
were shewn to be essential to the result‒extreme
pressure, and extreme cold. The pressure was
obtained by strong mechanical appliances, and the
cold by means of solidified carbonic acid, which
looked like lumps of snow. In this way the
lecturer made clear to a general audience the process
by which a number of gases had been brought
into a liquid or solid form; and he stated that he
had ‘hoped to make oxygen the subject of the
evening’s experiment, but from some undetected
cause it had baffled his attempts at solidification.’
Nevertheless, he looked forward to the time when
not only oxygen, but azote and hydrogen would
be solidified, and he agreed with Dumas, of the
Institute of France, that hydrogen would shew
itself in the form of a metal.</p>

<p>Faraday’s anticipation is now realised in one
particular, for oxygen has been liquefied. This
achievement is due to the enlightened and persevering
efforts of Mr Pictet, an able physicist of
Geneva. Working with apparatus capable of resisting
a pressure of eight hundred atmospheres, and
a temperature sixty-five degrees below zero (centigrade),
he succeeded in converting oxygen (invisible)
into a visible liquid which spouted from the tube
in which it had been inclosed for experiment. It
is a feat which involves important consequences
for science. It is a further confirmation of the
mechanical theory of heat, according to which all
gases are vapours capable of passing through the
three states‒solid, liquid, and gaseous. Geneva
winds up the year with a fine scientific triumph.
Will Albemarle Street supplement it by liquefying
or solidifying azote and hydrogen? Just as these
lines are going to press we hear a rumour that it
has been done by a Frenchman at Paris.</p>

<p>Experiments have been made to measure the
sound-impulse produced in a telephone by ordinary
speaking; but it is too feeble to excite even
a delicate galvanometer. But a slight swing of
the free end of the instrument affects the needle,
which moves in a different direction according as
the swing is south, north, west, or east. There is
no doubt, as we observed in a recent paper on the
subject, that in the behaviour of the telephone
and the phenomena of its currents scientific men
have a promising subject of inquiry. Meanwhile,
as explained at the end of this article, the notion
that it would at once supersede other forms of
telegraphy or telephony will abate. A telephone
has no advantage over a speaking-tube within
the distances where a tube is available. Moreover
the needlessly high price at which it is to
be sold will be an effectual bar to its general use.
To ask thirty-five pounds and twenty-five pounds
for an article that could be sold at a profit for so
many shillings, is not and ought not to be the
way to commercial success.</p>

<p>It is stated in a French scientific periodical that
underground water may be discovered by observing
the quivering of the air on a clear calm
summer afternoon when the sun is low. If a well
be dug at the spot where the quivering appears,
a supply of water will, as is said, there be found.
And as regards the influence of trees on moisture,
careful observation has confirmed the theory that
more rain falls on forests than on open plains;
and comparing different kinds of trees it is found
that the pine tribe get more water and retain
more than leafy trees. Hence, it is said, pines
are the best defence against sudden inundations,
and the best means for giving freshness and
humidity to a hot and dry climate such as that
of Algeria, where attempts at amelioration have
been made by planting, and by the digging of
artesian wells.</p>

<p>Readers of this <cite>Journal</cite> will not be ignorant of
the health-imparting properties of the Australian
gum-tree, or eucalyptus, nor that the fir and pine
possess similar properties, but in a minor degree,
yet still sufficient to enhance the title to salubrity
of certain watering-places. Mr Kingzett, an ingenious
and persevering chemist, had tried for a
long time to discover whether the active atmospheric
element, ozone, was evolved from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
leaves of plants, and was forced to the conclusion
that the element produced was not ozone, but
peroxide of hydrogen. He then experimented on
oils of different kinds, and found that they absorbed
oxygen rapidly, and were thereby in some
instances transformed into new substances. Among
them all turpentine proved to be the best absorber;
and it appeared on further experiment
that while one portion became resinified, another
portion was converted into peroxide of hydrogen
and camphoric acid. The natural conclusion from
this result was that the eucalyptus and the pine
owe their salubrious properties to the presence of
these two substances; or rather to the ‘terpene,’
or principle of turpentine, with which they are
imbued. This point established, measures were
taken to produce the sanifying substances on a
large scale; and now a company owning a manufactory
in the east of London advertise that they
are ready to supply the new disinfectant under
the name of <em>Sanitas</em> in any quantity. It is not
poisonous, will not stain the materials to which it
may be applied, can be used as a wholesome scent,
and is efficacious in preserving articles of food.
The process of manufacture is ingenious, and is so
combined that there is no waste of turpentine even
in the form of vapour; but of the details we need
not attempt an explanation here. Suffice it that
<em>Sanitas</em>, with full description of its virtues, is now
largely advertised in the public journals.</p>

<p>Professor Galloway, of the Royal College of
Science, Dublin, has published a pamphlet in
which he states that salted meat is unwholesome,
and produces scurvy, because by the process of
salting the meat is deprived of important constituents,
notably phosphate of potash. He says
that if this salt were eaten with the beef served
out on board ship, the meat would be nutritious,
would not occasion scurvy; and he calls on the
Admiralty to test his view by actual experiment.</p>

<p>What a convenience it would be if all the street
lamps of a town could be lighted and put out at
once! Mr Lane Fox has proved at a commercial
station in the neighbourhood of Fulham that it
can be done. All the lamps are connected by
wires overhead or underground; to each burner is
fitted an electro-magnet composed of a coil of wire
round a soft iron core, and above it hangs a
movable magnet. The ends of the connecting
wires are attached to or detached from a battery
at pleasure. When the gas is to be lighted, a
current is sent through the wires; the electro-magnet
on each burner is excited; the movable
magnet swings round, and turns on the gas; a
current from a powerful coil is then sent through
the wires, and produces a spark at each burner,
and thereby lights the gas. The putting out is
effected by a reverse current. From twenty to
forty lamps have been thus treated, and with
entire success; and it is thought that three hundred
might be included in the circuit with a like
satisfactory result.</p>

<p>Thus in order to light up London or any other
large town, the lamps would have to be divided
into groups of three hundred. The lamplighter,
or man in charge of the battery, would of course
require to know that none had been missed, and
this could be made certain by placing the first and
last lamp of the group within sight of his station.
If they are alight, then all are alight. The practicability
of the operation appears therefore to be
settled. The next question is‒Will it prove a
saving to the ratepayers?</p>

<p>Complaints that ordinary gas-light is not so
brilliant as it ought to be, are often heard, and
not without reason. The Pure Carbon Gas Company
claim for their gas that it is not open to
the objections urged against other gas. The process
of manufacture has the merit of being very
simple, and free from the usual noxious results.
At a demonstration made a few weeks since, proof
was given that but little space and little skill
are required in the manufacture. The tar formed
during the process, instead of being carried away
as at present, is passed back into the retorts,
whereby, as is said, three thousand feet more of
gas can be produced from a ton of coal than by
the ordinary process. An arrangement is introduced
which separates the ammonia and the
sulphur, and in consequence this pure carbon
gas has but little smell. Ordinary gas is passed
as good if it contains not more than twenty-five
grains of sulphur to the hundred feet: the quantity
in the new gas is less than three grains. We
are told that the cost of manufacture is not more
than eighteenpence the thousand cubic feet, that it
does not require skilled labour, that in consequence
of its freedom from smell it could be carried on
in a ship or in a house, while its simplicity
renders it applicable to villages where at present
there are no public lights. The Collinge Engineering
Works, Westminster Bridge Road, are
mentioned as the place where the demonstration
above described was given.</p>

<p>With a view to account for the presence of
mineral oil underground in certain parts of
Europe and in Pennsylvania, some ingenious
persons have assumed that the oil is a decomposition-product
of long-buried organic remains. But
the answer to this is that the oil is found in very
old strata ‘where but few organic remains can have
existed.’ Mr D. Mendelejeff, a foreign chemist,
having visited the Pennsylvania wells, puts forward
his opinion on this interesting question:
The substance of the earth having been condensed
from vapour, ‘the interior of the earth must consist
largely of metals (iron predominating) in
combination with carbon. Wherever fissures have
been produced in the earth’s crust by volcanic
action, the water, which of necessity made its way
into the interior, and thus came into contact with
metallic carbides at high temperatures and pressures,
must have given rise to saturated hydrocarbons,
which have ascended in the form of
vapour to strata where they condensed,’ and thus
formed the oil.</p>

<p>Captain Calver, R.N., has by command of the
Admiralty surveyed the Thames below Woolwich
to ascertain whether the discharge of the sewage of
London into the river has created obstructions in
the channel. The captain has published his report,
and a very discouraging report it is, for it makes
known that shoals have formed, and are forming,
which in course of time will completely stop the
navigation of the river. In this we have a proof
that it is a mistake to send the solid portion of
sewage into a stream, in the hope that it will be
effectually carried away by the tide. It is not
carried away; but is deposited at the bends, and
in the eddies, with detriment to health as well as
to the water-way.</p>

<p>Engineers who contend that none but neutralised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
liquid sewage should pass into a river are manifestly
in the right. To discharge the solids is a
waste as well as a mischief; and if it goes on, the
whole of the land will some day be utterly starved
for want of nitrogen. Some theorists argue that
it won’t pay to attempt to convert the solids into a
fertilising material. The answer to this is the
experience gained at Aylesbury, where the solid
part of the town sewage is separated from the
liquid by precipitation; is converted into a fertiliser,
part of which is used on the town-farm, and
the surplus, in the form of a dry, scentless powder,
is sold at three pounds ten shillings the ton. A
single grain of oats, sown on land treated with this
powder, produced seven thousand grains from one
root, and other grains yielded varying numbers
down to two thousand. The powder on analysis
seems poor; but its richness of productive power
may be judged of from the foregoing statement.</p>

<p>A new process for making sulphate of soda has
been invented by M. Fournier, a Frenchman. It
leaves behind as waste liquid a large quantity of a
certain chloride, which turns out to be excellent
for the precipitation of sewage. Hence it appears
that nature and science combine to shew how the
fertility of the land and the free channels of rivers
may alike be maintained. The process has been
patented in this country, and if all go well we
may hope, in time, to hear that the sewage of
London, instead of filling up the bed of the Thames,
is increasing the fruitfulness of fields, gardens, and
meadows in Essex and Kent.</p>

<p>Meteorologists, in their review of the weather,
inform us that in the gale on the 11th of November
last, the barometer was lower, the wind stronger,
and the rainfall greater, than on any other day in
the year. The mean velocity of the wind was
thirty-eight miles an hour; and the rainfall in
twenty-four hours amounted to a little more than
an inch and a half. The fall for the whole month
was in Sussex, eight and a quarter inches; in Cumberland,
nine and three-quarter inches; being, as regards
the Sussex gauge, more than five inches above
the average of the previous ten years. The total
rainfall in eleven months, January to November,
was thirty-three and one-third inches: a remarkable
excess over twenty-eight inches, which is the
usual average for the whole year. For those who
are curious in comparisons we take a fact from the
weather-records of New South Wales: at Newcastle
in that colony there fell on March 18, 1871,
more than ten and a half inches of rain in two
hours and a half.</p>

<p>Two official papers published in India further
discuss the question‒sun-spots and rainfall. ‘The
Cycle of Drought and Famine in Southern India,’
contains a statement of the argument by Dr W.
W. Hunter, and the conclusions to which he has
arrived. These are: ‘That although no uniform
numerical relation can be detected between the
relative number of sun-spots and the actual amount
of rainfall, yet that the minimum period in the
cycle of sun-spots is a period of regularly recurring
and strongly marked drought in Southern India‒That
apart from any solar theory, an examination
of the rain registers shews that a period of deficient
rainfall recurs in cycles of eleven years at
Madras ... that the statistical evidence shews
that the cycle of rainfall at Madras has a marked
coincidence with a corresponding cycle of sun-spots
... and that the evidence tends also to
shew that the average rainfall of the years of
minimum rainfall in the said cycle approaches
perilously near to the point of deficiency which
causes famine.’ The average is, however, above
that point; and though droughts and famines may
recur in the cyclic years of minimum rainfall, the
evidence, in Dr Hunter’s opinion, is insufficient to
warrant the prediction of a regularly recurring
famine.</p>

<p>The observations on which these conclusions
are founded include sixty-four years of the present
century: too short a period on which to build a
theory; but as no records exist earlier than 1810,
it is by future observation only that the conclusions
can be tested. Meanwhile meteorological observers
will be watchful, especially of the rainfall, for
India is a country which affords singularly favourable
opportunities for a comprehensive system of
observations.</p>

<p>The other paper referred to above is by Mr H.
F. Blanford, Meteorological Reporter to the government
of India. He points out that Dr Hunter’s
views apply exclusively to Southern India, and
that in Northern India famines are most frequent
at the epochs of most sun-spots. This lack of
agreement between two competent authorities
shews how great is the need for a lengthened
series of observations.</p>

<p>In the recent Arctic Expedition twenty-five
species of fossil plants were discovered in Grinnell
Land by Captain Feilden. They are of the period
described by geologists as Miocene, and can be
identified with species of the same period found in
Europe, in North-western America, and in Asia.
Among them are two kinds of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Equisetum</i>, poplar,
birch, elm, and pine. It was suggested at a meeting
of the Geological Society that the bed of lignite
in which these remains were met with was in
remote ages a large peat-moss, probably containing
a lake in which the water-lilies grew, while on its
muddy shores the large reeds and sedges and
birches and poplars flourished. The drier spots
and neighbouring chains of hills were probably
occupied by the pines and firs, associated with elm
and hazel. Among all these which indicate a
primeval forest, the only sign of animal life discovered
was a solitary wing-case of a beetle.</p>

<p>When water-lilies were growing in that now
desolate region, fresh-water must have filled the
ponds and lakes. Captain Feilden’s discovery
may be taken as additional evidence of a change
of climate, which the palæontologists and physicists
who are now discussing that interesting question
will not fail to make use of on fitting occasion.</p>

<p>A few years ago the British Association appointed
a committee of eminent mathematicians
to consider ‘the possibility of improving the
methods of instruction in elementary geometry.’
The Report of this committee was published in the
stout volume which contains the account of the
meeting held at Glasgow. It states that the main
practical difficulty in effecting the improvement is
‘that of reconciling the claims of the teacher to
greater freedom with the necessity of one fixed
and definite standard for examination purposes;’
that ‘no text-book yet produced is fit to succeed
Euclid in the position of authority, and that a
syllabus of propositions in a definite sequence to
be regarded as a standard sequence for examination
purposes, might be published.’ Such a
syllabus as is here implied has been brought out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
by the Association for the improvement of geometrical
teaching; and the committee recommend
it for adoption by the universities and other
great examining bodies of the United Kingdom.
‘It may be well to observe,’ they say in their
Report, ‘that the adoption of this or some such
standard syllabus would not necessitate the abandonment
of the Elements of Euclid as a text-book
by such teachers as still preferred it to any other,
as it would at the utmost involve only such supplementary
teaching as is contained in the notes
appended to many of the editions of Euclid now
in use; while it would greatly relieve that large
and increasing body of teachers who demand
greater freedom in the treatment of geometry
than under existing conditions they can venture
to adopt.’</p>

<p>Supplementary to our recent notices of the telephone,
the following remarks, translated from a
late number of the <cite>Telegraph Bulletin</cite> of the
Ottoman administration, and dealing with a question
of some importance to telegraph manipulators
throughout the world, may be read with
interest:</p>

<p>‘Is the telephone, yes or no, destined to replace
other telegraph instruments; and seeing the possibility
that people may use it without special
training, is it in the end destined to destroy the
career of telegraph employés? Those questions
merit from us the labour of being examined with
care. We think that that instrument will never
be able to be employed in telegraphic working
destined to serve governments and the public. In
effect, supposing the instrument perfect, arrived at
the last limits of perfection, and able to work at
all distances with or without relays, then‒1. To
transmit a message with all the advantages offered
by the system, it would be necessary that the
sender should be able to speak himself directly
with the receiver, without the intervention of an
employé. Now, all those who know the organisation
of the lines know that this is not possible,
that there must necessarily be intermediary offices
of deposit, that the public cannot be admitted to
the offices where messages are transmitted or received,
and consequently the sender must give his
message <em>written</em>. 2. An employé once charged
with the message, the instrument has already lost
one of its principal advantages, for that employé
must read the message, and pronounce it to his
correspondent; but if the message is written in a
foreign language, the impracticability is evident.
Lastly, the telegraph administrations now
possess instruments which permit them to send
messages with much greater speed than can be
attained in sending them by the voice. Those
reasons alone, and there are many others, ought
then to assure the employés that this new invention
will not put in peril their means of
existence.</p>

<p>‘This is not to say that the telephone will not
be utilised. On the contrary, it will probably be
much used, but in special cases and for private
use. For example: To put any chief in immediate
relation with his employés in offices or manufactories;
for the police of towns for announcing fires;
for service of mines; to replace with advantage
electric bells in many cases; and in a crowd of circumstances
not yet foreseen. Let us wish then
good success to this invention, which does honour
to the era of steam and electricity.’</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following account of extraordinary sagacity
on the part of a mouse has been sent to us by a
contributor, who vouches for the truth of the
statement: ‘At my house, in a trap for catching
mice alive, which had been overlooked for some
weeks, was found the nest of a mouse with several
young, all alive with their mother; and some
<em>other mice which had died of starvation</em>. The
only explanation, I think, which can be given of
so strange an occurrence is that the male mouse,
knowing by instinct the condition of his mate,
provided for her wants by bringing to her the
materials for her nest, which she pulled in through
close wires, and supplied her with food, while he
allowed all the others‒the non-related captives‒to
starve to death. It seems almost more than
instinct that the male mouse should not have
entered the trap, where there was such attraction
for him, as though he knew that on his liberty
depended the lives of the mother and her offspring.’</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
